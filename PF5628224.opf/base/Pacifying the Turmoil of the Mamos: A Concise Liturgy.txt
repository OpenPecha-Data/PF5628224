Pacifying the Turmoil of the Mamos: A Concise Liturgy
by Shechen Gyaltsab Gyurme Pema Namgyal

jo, nangsi mamo khandrö tsok nam la
Jo. Mamos and Ḍākinīs of all that appears and exists,
detong zakmé chötor di bulwé
I offer you this torma of inexhaustible bliss and emptiness –
chinang mamo trukpé nyé kün shyi
May all the troubles that infuriate the inner and outer Mamos be pacified
lhenkyé dewa chenpö ngödrub tsol
And the accomplishment of great spontaneous bliss bestowed!
sarwa daka dakini sapariwara maha balingta khahi
sarva ḍāka ḍākinī saparivāra mahā baliṃ te khāhi
om benza sattva ah
oṃ vajra sattva āḥ

Seeing there was a need for such a liturgy, the mantrika who delights Padmasambhava, [Shechen
Gyaltsab, Gyurme Pema Namgyal] composed this at the delightful Pema Lhatse in Shang Zabbu
Lung, Tsang Province, on the twenty-eighth day of the month during the Iron Bird year. May
virtue prevail.
