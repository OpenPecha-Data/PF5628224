A Concise Feast Prayer
by Shechen Gyaltsab Pema Namgyal

ram yam kham om ah hung
Raṃ yaṃ khaṃ! Oṃ āḥ hūṃ!
rabjam tsa sum kyilkhor lhatsok shek
Deities of the infinite Three Roots and maṇḍalas, please come,
yeshe ngaden döyön tsokchö shyé
Accept and enjoy this feast offering of the sensory delights of fivefold wisdom!
tukdam kang shying nyamchak galtrul shak
May your hearts be fulfilled as I confess all transgressions, confusions, impairments and breakages!
zungdzin ying drol choktün ngödrub tsol
Liberate dualistic fixation into space, and grant me supreme and ordinary siddhis, I pray!
Recite the hundred-syllable mantra.

By Padma Vijaya.
