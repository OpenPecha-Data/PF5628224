A Prayer of Aspiration
by Shechen Gyaltsab Pema Namgyal

dorjé lobpön shyabpé kal gyar ten
May the lotus feet of vajra masters remain for hundreds of aeons,
dorjé checham damtsik nampar dak
May the samaya vows of vajra brothers and sisters remain completely pure,
dorjé sum gyi nyamlen tarchin né
May the practices of the three vajras be perfected,
dorjé sang chok tsé dir drub gyur chik
And may we attain the supremely secret vajra in this very life!

By Vijaya.
